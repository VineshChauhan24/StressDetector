# StressDetector
Implemented an android based application for stress detection and management under consultation of a psychiatrist Dr. Devendra Save and his team of psychologists as my final year project.
App provides visualization tools such as graphs for doctors to track the periodic progress of the patient. Graphs were generated from the answers patient submitted for questionnaire through the same app.
App can be used by doctor as well as patients and contains different GUI for both.
Implemented a personal diary space for the patient.
Used android studio for developing the application.
